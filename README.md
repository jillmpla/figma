# 💖 Celebrity Charm – Figma Prototype  

Celebrity Charm is an online dating mobile application prototype built in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). It allows users to search for matches, review profiles, chat through text or video, and explore compatibility through quizzes and games.  

> 📌 This project was approached as a **full UX case study**, from storyboarding and wireframing to prototyping, user testing, and iteration.

## 📖 Case Study Overview  

**Inspiration & Problem Space**  
Dating apps today often rely heavily on profile swiping, which can feel shallow and repetitive. Many users want more ways to evaluate compatibility and interact meaningfully before meeting.  

**Goal**  
Explore how a dating app could combine traditional matching with playful, interactive activities and more personalized discovery.  

**Solution**  
Celebrity Charm integrates user preferences, profile reviews, text/video communication, and gamified experiences into one cohesive prototype. The Figma prototype was used to simulate real user flows and test usability.

- Send text messages or record video replies  
- View clear indicators for unread messages  

### Activities  
- Play quizzes (e.g., *Fitness Fanatic or Zen Seeker?*)  
- Try compatibility games (like "Match Mosaic")  
- Archive and revisit completed results

## 🧩 Design Elements & Patterns  

- **Interactive Components:** dropdowns, sliders, radio buttons, modals, chat boxes  
- **Navigation:** global bottom bar, back arrows for clear escape routes  
- **Layouts:** stacked cards, scrollable lists, carousels  
- **Consistency:** cohesive iconography, minimal palette, branded typography

## 👥 User Testing & Findings  

We conducted **in-person usability testing** with 4 participants.  

**Positive Feedback**  
- Clear task flows and playful activities  
- Video chat and quizzes felt engaging  
- Consistent branding across screens  

**Pain Points**  
- Icons like “save for later” were confusing  
- Some arrows looked interactive when they weren’t  
- Small text sizing in multiple places  
- Sending videos lacked confirmation steps  

**Lessons Learned**  
- Labels and clearer button states improved navigation  
- Scroll indicators reduced confusion  
- Consistency in UI feedback built trust  
- Activities should be inclusive, with recognizable labels and flows

## 📊 Fidelity & Inspirations  

- **Interaction Design:** High fidelity (full click-through flows)  
- **Information & Visual Design:** High fidelity (consistent layouts, branding)  
- **Editorial Content:** High fidelity (realistic content in chats, quizzes, and profiles)  

**Inspired by:**  
- **Hinge** → segmented preferences and chat design  
- **Tinder** → swipe-based liking/discarding interactions  
- **Buzzfeed-style quizzes/gamified engagement** → more interactive than typical dating apps
